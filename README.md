# RShiny_Project

The goal of this project was to build a dashboard for my current employer's Downstream Processing Team (DSP) to enable tracking of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and querying of experimental data without writing SQL commands. This code can be easily tweaked to pull from a relational database rather than a CSV file, enabling real-time dashboarding if using a data warehouse.

Note, the data used for this project has been redacted and modified to hide proprietary information, but the dashboard's functionality has been preserved.
